Bubble sort - Checks two adjacent elements in an array swaps them if in wrong order then repeats it until it's done.

- is the slowest on average
- very basic linear approach, easy to understand however.
- Suffers heavily from worst case time complexity due to having to sequentially compare every element pair.
- Works in ascending, descending and random. However fall off significantly in random order with larger sets of data.

Selection sort - Finds the smallest element in array first, inserts it in the first position then checks the remaining elements a puts smallest in next position and so on.

- fastest than bubble on everything but the smallest data sets
- desceding order results were comparable to random unlike others.

Insertion sort - Constantly attempts to place the current element in the right order, one by one.

- By far the fastest.
- Still suffers heavily from time complexity.
- Slow at sorting arrays in desceding order in larger data sets.
